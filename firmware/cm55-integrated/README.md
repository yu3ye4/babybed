# XiaoZhi Sample Project

**中文** | [**English**](./README.md)

## Introduction

This sample project is based on the **Edgi-Talk platform**, demonstrating the **basic functions of the XiaoZhi voice interaction device**, running on the **RT-Thread real-time operating system**.
With this project, users can quickly verify the device’s **WiFi connection**, **button wake-up**, and **voice interaction** capabilities, providing a fundamental reference for further application development.

## Software Description

* The project is developed based on the **Edgi-Talk** platform.
* The sample includes the following functions:

  * WiFi connection and status display
  * Button wake-up and voice interaction
  * Device state management (standby, listening, sleep, etc.)

## Usage

### Prepare Wi-Fi resources (first-time setup)

The Wi-Fi host driver loads three blobs (firmware `.bin`, regulatory `.clm_blob`, and board-specific `nvram.txt`) from FAL before it can power up the radio. These files live outside the application image, so flashing a new binary will not refresh them automatically. The default bundles for Edgi-Talk live in the workspace root under `resources/`.

- Keep `WHD_RESOURCES_IN_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_FAL` enabled in menuconfig and make sure the FAL table provides the `whd_firmware`, `whd_clm`, and `whd_nvram` partitions (the defaults reserve 512 KB + 32 KB + 32 KB of on-chip flash).
- Attach a serial terminal, reboot into the `msh` prompt, and run the download helper for each partition:

```
whd_res_download whd_firmware
whd_res_download whd_clm
whd_res_download whd_nvram
```

Each command switches to YMODEM mode. Use a terminal that supports YMODEM upload (Xshell) to send the matching files from the top-level `resources/` directory .
- Wait for the `Download … success` message before moving to the next partition.
- Power-cycle or reset the board after the three transfers so Wi-Fi starts with the freshly stored blobs. Re-run the command whenever you update the firmware/CLM/NVRAM bundle.

### 1. First-time setup (AP configuration)

1. When the development board starts, it will enter **AP mode**.
   Connect your phone or computer to the device hotspot (password shown on the screen):

2. After a successful connection, open a browser and enter **192.168.169.1** to access the configuration interface:

3. Click **Scan** to search for nearby Wi-Fi hotspots:

4. After the WiFi connection is successful, the following page will be displayed:

5. When the device screen shows **“Standby”**, it means voice interaction is ready:

> **Tip:** Press the **first user button** on the development board to enter voice input. After waiting 1–2 seconds, XiaoZhi will automatically respond.

## XiaoZhi Expression Meaning

### 1. Connecting (please wait)

> To exit sleep: press the button → wait for “Standby” → interaction becomes available.

### Running Effect

* After flashing, the device will start the sample automatically on power-up.
* Press the top button once to enter the **Listening** state and interact with the device.

  Press the user button to display the verification code on the screen.

* Please ensure the WiFi SSID and password are correct and that you are using a **2.4GHz network**.

* The device requires an Internet connection to function properly.

* If you need to modify the **graphical configuration**, use the following tools:

```
tools/device-configurator/device-configurator.exe
libs/TARGET_APP_KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC2/config/design.modus
```

* Save changes and regenerate code after modification.

## Startup Sequence

```
+------------------+
|   Secure M33     |
|  (Secure Core)   |
+------------------+
          |
          v
+------------------+
|       M33        |
| (Non-Secure Core)|
+------------------+
          |
          v
+-------------------+
|       M55         |
| (Application Core)|
+-------------------+
```

⚠️ Flash in this order strictly to ensure proper operation.

---

* If the example does not run, first compile and flash **Edgi_Talk_M33_Blink_LED**.
* To enable M55:

```
RT-Thread Settings --> Hardware --> select SOC Multi Core Mode --> Enable CM55 Core
```
